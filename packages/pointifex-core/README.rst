============

Pointifex is a collection of Kanso CouchApp modules which are intended to make the development of document based spatial applications faster and more robust. It uses GeoCouch databases, which have the geocouch-utils CouchApp by @maxogen deployed as the datastore, and integrates with a LeafletJS map front end to provide the interaction component.
